                </div>

                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                    different
                    beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as
                    long as
                    he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not
                    wanting to
                    admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
                <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                    energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his
                    toys "a
                    ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

                <img src="images/pluto/pluto.jpg" width="400" alt="White dog looking up.">


                <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to
                    the
                    Valley
                    Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
                    personality,
                    he
                    was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the window to
                    keep watch of his house. Do not let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
                    mailman
                    and squirrels every single day.</P>
                <p>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto favorite part of the day
                    is
                    his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his
                    toy
                    duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some
                    practice with his toy duck.</p>

                    friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not allowed
                    to
                    give chase.</P>
                <p>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold weather.

                <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose.
                    Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest.
                    Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.</p>
                <P>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will 'say hi' to you
                    after
                    a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size dogs
                    are
                    hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don't hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super
                    happy
                    the whole day.</P>

                <p>Sprout, a shy and elusive kitten when he first arrived at four months old, gradually became an
                    affectionate companion. He enjoyed sleeping on my bed, but his early morning wake-up calls at 6:30
                    AM
                    were a daily routine.</P>
                <p>During my challenging academic phase, Sprout became my constant companion during late-night drawing
                    sessions, quietly curling up on my lap, providing comfort and banishing solitude.
